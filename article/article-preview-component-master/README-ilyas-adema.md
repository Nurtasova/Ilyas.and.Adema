## Overview

My partner Adema and I worked on the practical work of the article preview component together , we did the work together

### Challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal component layout depending on the screen size of their device
- See social media sharing links when they click on the sharing icon

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a screenshot". You can choose either a full-length screenshot or a cropped one, depending on the length of the page. If it is very long, it may be better to trim it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com /) to take a screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to buy it.

Then crop/optimize/edit the image the way you like, add it to your project and update the file path in the image above.


### Links

We have added links to Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest.

We also added a link to the site in the lower parts of the site (https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/article-preview-component-dYBN_pYFT ) and those who created this section .

## My process

Our progress is in javascript, we used to know how the console works, now we already know a lot of things.


We also learned how to use pseudo-elements after, before, etc.


### Built with

- HTML5 semantic markup
- Custom CSS properties
- Flexible drawer
- CSS Grid
- Mobile is the first workflow
- [React] (https://reactjs.org /) - JS library
- [Next.js ](https://nextjs.org /) - Response structure
- [Stylized components] (https://styled-components.com /) - For styles


###What I learned

We started creating a link table, pseudo-elements, a link window that appears when clicked.

To learn how to add code snippets, see below:

``html
<h1> Some HTML code I'm proud of </h1>
``
``css
.proud-of-this-css{
color: papaya;
}
``
"js
constant pride in this feature = ()=> {
console.journal (' ðŸŽ‰ ')
}
``

If you need additional help writing markdown, we recommend reading the [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org /) to learn more.


### Continued development

Pseudo-elements still need to be studied and javascript just needs a lot of practice. While working, we looked a lot at other sites to find out whether the elements were displayed or to change the colors or size.

### Useful resources

- (https://www.w3schools.com /) - It helped me for some reason. I really liked this template and I will use it in the future.
- (https://webref.ru/layout/after-before/pseudo-elements ) is an amazing article that helped me finally understand pseudo elements. I would recommend this to anyone who is still learning Pseudoelements.
